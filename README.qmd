# VegSci.jl

`VegSci.jl` is a package containing tools for vegetation science using Julia [@bezanson2017], a growing scientific programming language which solves the 'two language problem' [@roesch2023], offering C and FORTRAN-like performance alongside the readability and user-friendliness of higher level languages such as Python.
`VegSci.jl` aims to collate selected functionality found in popular vegetation science software programs/packages such as JUICE [@tichy2002], vegan [@oksanen2022], ade4 [@dray2007], vegclust [@decaceres2010; @decaceres2013], and vegsoup [@kaiser2021] into a single location with a user-friendly API and transparent methodologies. 
`VegSci.jl` is being developed with the aim of assisting in the creation of high-performance, reproducible analytical pipelines in vegetation research [@sperandii2024], developed primarily with the application to the vegetation of Great Britain in mind, but fully generalisable.
Nomenclature follows @theurillat2021.

## Design

`VegSci.jl` is structured around the Julia package `NamedArrays.jl` facilitating the use of named relev√© by species matrices, which constitute the basic input for most functions.

<summary><b>Documentation</b></summary>

Run `quarto check` in the terminal to check whether Quarto is ok.

If Julia has been updated you will need to re-install the IJulia kernel
by running `using IJulia` then `installkernel("Julia")` in the Julia
terminal.

To render the README run `quarto render README.qmd --to md`

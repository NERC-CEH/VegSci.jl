# VegSci.jl

`VegSci.jl` is a package containing tools for vegetation science using the Julia [@bezanson2017], a growing scientific programming language which solves the 'two language problem' [@@roesch2023], offering C and FORTRAN-like performance alongside the readability and user-friendliness of higher level languages such as Python.
`VegSci.jl` aims to collate selected functionality found in popular vegetation science software programs/packages such as JUICE, vegan, ade4, vegclust, vegsoup, and ecotraj into a single location with a user-friendly API and transparent methodologies. 
`VegSci.jl` is being developed with the aim of assisting in the creation of high-performance, reproducible analysis pipelines in vegetation research [@sperandii2024], developed primarily with the application to the vegetation of Great Britain in mind, but fully generalisable.
Nomenclature follows @theurillat2021.
